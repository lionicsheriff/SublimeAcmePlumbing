    Add a rule to the user settings

    Rules are saved in this format:

    The key is used to determine whether the rule can be replaced in place, or if it has to be inserted into
    the pipeline. New rules are placed at the very top.

    The user settings are used because it gives the user the best control and visibility about their plumbing.
    This way they can see the extra rule and move/delete it
